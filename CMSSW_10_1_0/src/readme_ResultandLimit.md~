We have Hists for

Lep BKG : Prediction with systematics
    	:Make El and Mu Histogram seperately

fake BKG: Prediction with systematics
Tau BKG:  Prediction with systematics

Signal:   Prediction with syatematics

Data:     Observation

Combine all tfour Bkg stacked with error addition:

Overlay Signal and DATA

Plot Ratio   Data/Prediction

# Script : python/MakeResultHists.py  : takes 8 agument: I data_onservation , 4 for Signals, 3 bkg file (one file for EL and Mu both), 1 name of output file:

TIP: best define the files internallly.

run as python python/MakeResultHists.py

dot SH script: makeDC.sh  :  put for each signal point: new confor for constant lifetime, different mass parameters

##) Make hists for DATA CArd , (for shape analysis):
    Script: python/LimitHistProducer.py  : takes data and Pridicted hists for bkg as required for Histmaking, and one signal at a time (implemented as loop, running one ti,e gives hists files for every signal differntly)
    Makes histograms according to names in Data card template.

##) Make data cards:

    script : python/DataCardMaker.py

    reads in the data card template: Produces data card fr every hist file fir shape analysis. (Loops over the differt lines and replaces text)
    1) call fujnction from main() as : makeonedatacard( lifetime = '10', mass = '1400'), replaces the arguments to get his files, All should be in accordance with output from previos code.

    simple read and write in tet fies code.

  Copy Hists and Data card to : /nfs/dust/cms/user/singha/LLCh/LIMIT/CMSSW_8_1_0/src/HiggsAnalysis/CompLimit/

Run as  : combine -M AsymptoticLimits datacard_1400LT10cm.txt
